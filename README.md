### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Joey
#### I write Python and cause trouble.
Hi, I'm Joey. But my friends call me The Joey. There's a story behind that, but I'll leave that for another time.

I like code. In fact, I've liked code for a very long time. Why? Because making things work is fun! Even more fun is taking something from a mere concept and making it into a reality. Even more more fun is seeing people using (and breaking) that thing!

I also like rock climbing. And cars. And beer. But those aren't really related to this. For the most part. Sometimes.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Open Source things for GoDaddy, and my side project, the Facet MUD Project 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TypeScript, Nim, Rust, Elixir, Go 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
